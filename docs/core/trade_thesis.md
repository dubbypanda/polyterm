# Trade Thesis

> Explainable market-level thesis composer for PolyTerm.

## Overview

`polyterm/core/trade_thesis.py` composes market metadata, CLOB order book context, risk scoring, local archive history, and cached whale-flow evidence into one deterministic market thesis. It exists so traders and agents can ask for one decision-support object instead of stitching together many commands.

The module is no-custody and read-only. It never places orders and never handles private keys.

## Usage

### CLI

```bash
polyterm thesis -m bitcoin --format json
polyterm thesis -m bitcoin --brief
```

### Python

```python
from polyterm.core.trade_thesis import TradeThesisEngine

engine = TradeThesisEngine()
result = engine.build("bitcoin")
```

## Output Shape

The result contains:

- `market`: input, Gamma ID, slug, condition ID, token IDs, title, probability, liquidity, volume, end date.
- `thesis`: direction, confidence, confidence inputs, confidence reasoning, summary, evidence, risks, and next actions.
- `orderbook`: CLOB spread, best bid, best ask, and level counts where available.
- `risk`: existing PolyTerm risk assessment.
- `local_history`: recent SQLite snapshot count and probability endpoints.
- `whale_flow`: market-specific cached large-trade summary from the local `trades` table.
- `evidence_sources`: structured source records for agents, including source ID, status, metrics, and source-specific records.
- `quality_flags`: missing token IDs, unavailable order book, no execution, and related caveats.

## How It Works

The engine resolves an identifier through Gamma, extracts CLOB token IDs with `market_utils`, queries CLOB order book depth for the primary token, scores market risk with `MarketRiskScorer`, checks local snapshot history, summarizes cached large trades matching the resolved market identifiers, and builds evidence, risk, and `evidence_sources` lists from those signals.

Confidence is intentionally explainable and conservative. It now returns both `confidence_inputs` and `confidence_reasoning` so agents can see why a score moved. Inputs include directional probability, liquidity, 24 hour volume, volume quality, order book availability, spread, visible depth levels, bid/ask depth, local history count, recent history movement, archive freshness, cached whale-flow counts and notional, risk grade, risk score, and resolution-clarity score.

The score increases when liquidity and volume are strong, the order book is available with a tight spread, visible depth exists, local archive history is fresh enough, cached whale flow is available, risk is low or moderate, and resolution criteria are clear. It decreases when risk or resolution ambiguity is high.

## Data Sources

- Gamma API for discovery and market metadata.
- CLOB API `/book` for current order book context.
- Local SQLite `market_snapshots`.
- Local SQLite `trades` populated by `wallet.whales` live Data API lookups.
- `core/risk_score.py` for risk grading.

## Agent Notes

Agents should treat `trade_thesis` as a decision-support object, not a command to trade. The manifest marks `analytics.thesis` as read-only and non-mutating. Agents should inspect `quality_flags`, `confidence_inputs`, and `confidence_reasoning` before relying on the thesis. `cached_whale_flow` means the thesis included market-specific local whale evidence; `whale_flow_unavailable` means the local cache has no matching large trades yet. Use `evidence_sources` when generating reports so each claim can point back to Gamma, CLOB, local snapshots, risk scoring, or cached whale-flow evidence.

## Verification

```bash
polyterm thesis -m bitcoin --format json
polyterm thesis -m bitcoin --brief
```

Add focused tests around market resolution, missing token IDs, unavailable CLOB order book, and local-history scoring.
